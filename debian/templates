Template: mkat/drive
Type: string
Default: /dev/cdrom
Description: Physical CD drive to get CD label from, etc.
 MKAT needs access to the physical CD drive to get CD labels, audio CD
 ids, rip audio CDs. Programs like cdparanoia(1) can be passed this value as a
 parameter.

Template: mkat/cd
Type: string
Description: CD drive mount point (optional)
 If you want to check if the CD you've burned does indeed contain data you
 intended, files from the burned CD can be compared with the files the iso
 image was created from. You need to specify a directory where to read CD
 files from.
 .
 USE AUTOFS TO MOUNT CD, MKAT WON'T MOUNT IT

Template: mkat/tmp
Type: string
Default: /tmp/$USER
Description: Temporary dir where to put iso images and ripped wav files.
 Specify a directory where an iso image will be created when you call burn(1).
 $USER will be replaced with the user name you run burn(1)
 (and other MKAT programs) under.
 Actually, $USER is just an environment variable.

Template: mkat/listdir
Type: string
Default: $HOME/.mkat
Description: Place to hold your CD catalog database
 mkat(1) creates a .list file for each CD, so that you have
 information about file names, size and md5 sums contained on a CD. This
 variable defines where those files are stored.

Template: mkat/autofs_delay
Type: string
Default: 6
Description: Amount of seconds to wait before ejecting CD
 This package presumes you use some kind of automounter that unmounts a
 media when it's no longer used for a certain amount of time.

Template: mkat/mkimage_opts
Type: string
Default: -J -file-mode 444 -graft-points
Description: Arguments for an image creation program (optional)
 These are additional mkisofs options. -V (label), -o (image) and files to
 put into image are passed automatically. Leave intact if unsure.

Template: mkat/mkimage_cmd
Type: string
Default: mkisofs $MKIMAGE_OPTS -V \"\$LABEL\" -o \"\$ISO_IMAGE\" \"\${FILES[@]}\"
Description: Command to create $ISO_IMAGE
 Ahh, the ultimate flexibility. But does anyone need that?

Template: mkat/cdrec_opts
Type: string
Default: -v
Description: cdrecord will be passed these arguments (optional)
 By default, -v (verbose mode) is specified. I can't think of any more
 options I would want to pass every time to cdrecord. If you want to burn
 in -dummy mode, just use burn(1) with -r option to passthrough the options
 to cdrecord.
 .
 Leave intact if unsure.

Template: mkat/iso_image
Type: string
Default: $TMP/cdimage.iso
Description: Filename for iso image to be created by burn(1)
 You're a control freak if you want to change this.
