Description: Burn, catalog, search data CD/DVD, audio CD or directories
 mkat is a set of command line tools to burn and catalog audio, data
 CD/DVD and arbitrary directories. Firstly, it's a convenient frontend to
 cdrecord/growisofs/mkisofs, secondly, it can catalog CD/DVDs.
 Catalog database can then be used to, for example, check whether
 you have a certain file or audio CD in your collection. Tags can be used 
 to categorize CD/DVDs, e.g. comedy, drama, kids, sports.
 .
 Options can be passed to the programs doing the real work:
 cdrecord/growisofs, mkisofs, grep. The catalog database consists
 of plain text files.
